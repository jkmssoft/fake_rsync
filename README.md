fake_rsync is a wrapper around rsync, which uses sshfs to mount remote
locations. This way it allows you to bypass any error caused by protocol
incompatibilities, misconfigured login messages on a server and many others.

```sh
Usage: fake_rsync [OPTIONS]... [USER@]HOST:SRC [DEST]
  or   fake_rsync [OPTIONS]... SRC [USER@]HOST:DEST
```
Please note it currently does not support using several SRC arguments. Neither
does it support any other communication protocol asides from remote shell. It
does, however, support the usage of all rsync options.
